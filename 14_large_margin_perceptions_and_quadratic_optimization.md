# Large Margin Perceptrons

Large Margin Perceptrons, also known as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), are a type of linear classifier that aims to find the best separating hyperplane between two or more classes. The idea behind large margin classifiers is to not only find a hyperplane that separates the classes but also to maximize the margin between the hyperplane and the nearest training examples from each class. These nearest examples are called support vectors, as they support the optimal separating hyperplane.

Maximizing the margin ensures better generalization and reduces the risk of overfitting, as the classifier is less sensitive to small perturbations in the training data. Large Margin Perceptrons can be extended to non-linear problems using kernel functions, which map the input data into higher-dimensional spaces where linear separation might be possible.

# Quadratic Optimization

Quadratic optimization is a type of mathematical optimization that deals with minimizing or maximizing a quadratic objective function subject to linear constraints. Quadratic optimization problems have a unique global minimum or maximum, and they can be solved efficiently using various numerical optimization techniques, such as the gradient descent method or specialized algorithms like Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO).

In the context of Large Margin Perceptrons, quadratic optimization is used to find the optimal weights for the separating hyperplane. The objective function in this case is the margin between the hyperplane and the support vectors, which is a quadratic function of the weights. The constraints are linear inequalities that ensure the correct classification of the support vectors. Solving this quadratic optimization problem yields the optimal weights for the large margin classifier, resulting in the best separating hyperplane.

## Primal Problem

The primal problem in quadratic optimization is the original problem formulation that seeks to minimize (or maximize) a quadratic objective function subject to linear constraints. The primal problem can be written as:

minimize: $f(x) = (1/2) * x^T * Q * x + c^T * x$
subject to: $Ax <= b$

Here:
- $x$ is the optimization variable
- $Q$ is a symmetric and positive semi-definite matrix, 
- $c$ is a constant vector, 
- $A$ is a matrix of constraint coefficients,
- $b$ is a constant vector representing the constraint bounds.

## Lagrange Multipliers

The method of Lagrange multipliers is a technique used to solve optimization problems with equality constraints. It introduces additional variables, called Lagrange multipliers, to transform the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained problem.

In the context of quadratic optimization, we can rewrite the primal problem with equality constraints ($Ax = b$) as a Lagrangian function:

$$
L(x, λ) = (1/2) * x^T * Q * x + c^T * x + λ^T * (Ax - b)
$$

Here, $λ$ is the vector of Lagrange multipliers.

By taking the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian function with respect to x and λ and setting them to zero, we obtain the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which are necessary conditions for optimality.

## Dual Problem

The dual problem is an alternative formulation of the original optimization problem that seeks to maximize (or minimize) a different objective function, known as the dual function. It is derived from the Lagrangian function by minimizing L(x, λ) with respect to x and then maximizing the resulting function with respect to λ.

For a quadratic optimization problem, the dual problem can be written as:

maximize: 
$$
g(λ) = - (1/2) * λ^T * (A * Q^(-1) * A^T) * λ - λ^T * (b - A * Q^(-1) * c)
$$
subject to: $λ >= 0$

Solving the dual problem provides a lower bound on the optimal value of the primal problem. In many cases, especially when dealing with convex optimization problems, the optimal values of the primal and dual problems are equal (called strong duality). Moreover, the dual problem often has fewer variables and constraints than the primal problem, making it computationally more tractable.

In summary, quadratic optimization involves solving the primal problem, which seeks to minimize a quadratic objective function subject to linear constraints. The method of Lagrange multipliers can be used to solve the primal problem with equality constraints, while the dual problem provides an alternative, often more computationally efficient, problem formulation that can be used to find the optimal solution.
