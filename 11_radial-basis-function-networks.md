Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) are a type of artificial neural network that use radial basis functions (RBFs) as activation functions in the hidden layer. RBFNs consist of an input layer, a single hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer passes the data to the hidden layer, which contains RBF neurons. The output layer computes the weighted sum of the hidden layer activations to produce the final output.

RBFs are localized functions, meaning they have a strong response in the vicinity of their center and decay rapidly as the input moves away from the center. This makes RBFNs particularly suitable for tasks where local patterns in the data are crucial, such as function approximation, regression, and pattern recognition.

There are four major methods for RBF training:

- **Fixed centers selected at random**: In this approach, the centers of the RBFs in the hidden layer are fixed and chosen randomly from the training data. The training process only adjusts the weights between the hidden layer and the output layer, typically using a least squares method. This method is simple and fast, but the randomly selected centers may not provide the best representation of the data.

- **Self-organized selection of centers**: This approach uses unsupervised learning methods, such as k-means clustering or competitive learning, to determine the centers of the RBFs. By organizing the centers based on the structure of the data, the network can better represent the underlying patterns. After the centers are determined, the output layer weights are trained using a least squares method or gradient descent.

- **Supervised selection of centers and spreads**: This method uses supervised learning techniques to determine the centers, spreads (widths), and output layer weights simultaneously. The centers and spreads are adjusted to minimize the error between the network output and the target output. One common approach is to use gradient descent or other optimization techniques to minimize the error.

- **Regularization**: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in RBFNs by adding a penalty term to the error function. The penalty term is typically based on the norm of the output layer weights, which encourages the network to use fewer hidden neurons and produce smoother approximations. Regularization can be used in combination with any of the previously mentioned training methods to improve generalization performance.

## Detailed overview of step by step flow

1. **Input layer**: The input layer consists of nodes that pass the input features to the hidden layer. Each node in the input layer corresponds to one feature of the input data. The input layer does not perform any computation.

2. Hidden layer: The hidden layer consists of a set of radial basis function neurons. Each neuron computes the distance between the input and its center (also called a prototype), and applies a radial basis function (RBF) as an activation function. The most commonly used RBF is the Gaussian function, defined as:

    $$
        φ(||x-c_i||) = exp(-β_i ||x-c_i||^2)
    $$
    
    Here, $x$ is the input vector, $c_i$ is the center of the i-th hidden neuron, $β_i$ is a positive constant that determines the spread (or width) of the radial basis function, and $||.||$ denotes the Euclidean distance. The output of each hidden neuron is a measure of similarity between the input and the neuron's center.

3. Output layer: The output layer computes a weighted sum of the hidden layer's outputs to produce the final output. In the case of regression, the output is a continuous value, whereas for classification, the output can be transformed using a softmax function to get class probabilities. The weights of the connections between the hidden layer and the output layer are learned during training.

Training an RBFN generally involves two main steps:

1. **Determine the centers and spreads of the hidden layer**: There are several methods to do this, such as:
    - Fixed centers selected at random: Choose random data points as centers and set the spreads based on the average distance between centers.
    - Self-organized selection of centers: Use clustering algorithms like k-means to group the input data and set the cluster centroids as centers. The spreads can be computed based on the average distance within each cluster.
    - Supervised selection of centers and spreads: Apply a greedy algorithm or a forward-backward search to iteratively select centers that minimize the training error. The spreads are adjusted accordingly.

2. **Train the output layer**: Once the centers and spreads are determined, you can train the output layer using supervised learning. Common techniques include gradient descent, least squares, or other optimization algorithms.

### Example 
Suppose we have a 2D dataset for a regression problem. We want to use an RBFN to approximate the underlying function. We follow these steps:

1. Normalize the input data to ensure the features have the same scale.
2. Select the number of hidden neurons and determine the centers and spreads using the k-means clustering algorithm.
3. Initialize the output layer's weights randomly.
4. For each input vector x, compute the output of the hidden layer using the Gaussian RBF activation function.
5. Compute the output of the network by taking the weighted sum of the hidden layer's outputs.
6. Calculate the error between the network's output and the target output.
7. Update the output layer's weights using gradient descent or another optimization algorithm.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 for multiple epochs or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of epochs or a minimum error threshold).

After training, the RBFN can be used to make predictions on new data points by passing them through the input layer, computing the hidden layer's outputs using the Gaussian RBF activation function, and calculating the output layer's weighted sum of the hidden layer's outputs.

To summarize, Radial Basis Function Networks work as follows:

1. Pass input features through the input layer.
2. In the hidden layer, calculate the similarity between the input and each neuron's center using a radial basis function (e.g., Gaussian function). This results in a measure of similarity for each hidden neuron.
3. In the output layer, compute a weighted sum of the hidden layer's outputs to produce the final output (for regression) or class probabilities (for classification).
4. During the training process, determine the centers and spreads of the hidden layer neurons and learn the weights of the connections between the hidden and output layers.
