Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) are a type of artificial neural network (ANN) consisting of multiple layers of neurons, or nodes, organized in a feedforward architecture. They are an extension of the single-layer Perceptron model, allowing for the representation of more complex, non-linear functions. MLPs are widely used for various tasks, such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition.

An MLP typically consists of three types of layers:

- **Input layer**: This layer represents the input features of the data. Each node in the input layer corresponds to a single input feature.

- **Hidden layers**: These layers are responsible for processing and transforming the input data into a higher-level representation. They consist of multiple neurons, each of which applies an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs. The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer can be adjusted according to the complexity of the problem.

- **Output layer**: This layer produces the final output of the network, which can be a continuous value in the case of regression or a probability distribution over classes in the case of classification. Like the neurons in the hidden layers, each neuron in the output layer applies an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs.

The main difference between a single-layer Perceptron and an MLP is the presence of one or more hidden layers. These hidden layers allow the MLP to learn and represent more complex functions compared to a single-layer Perceptron, which can only learn linearly separable patterns.

To train an MLP, the backpropagation algorithm is used. Backpropagation is a supervised learning technique that adjusts the weights and biases of the network to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the true labels. It is an iterative optimization method that employs the gradient descent algorithm to update the model parameters. Backpropagation works by first computing the error for each output neuron and then propagating this error backward through the network, updating the weights and biases accordingly.

In summary, Multilayer Perceptrons are feedforward artificial neural networks with multiple layers of neurons, including input, hidden, and output layers. They are capable of learning and representing more complex, non-linear functions compared to single-layer Perceptrons. MLPs are trained using the backpropagation algorithm, which adjusts the weights and biases of the network to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the true labels.
