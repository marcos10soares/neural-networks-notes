# Problem definition
# let's consider a simple portfolio optimization problem. 
# We have two assets, A and B, with expected returns and 
# a covariance matrix representing their risk. Our goal 
# is to find the optimal weights for these assets in our 
# portfolio to minimize the portfolio risk (variance) 
# while achieving a target return.

# Assume the following:

# Expected returns:
# asset_A_return = 0.1 (10%)
# asset_B_return = 0.2 (20%)

# Covariance matrix:
# cov_matrix = [[0.01, 0.0012],
# [0.0012, 0.04]]

# Target return: 0.15 (15%)

# The quadratic optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

# minimize: f(w) = (1/2) * w^T * Σ * w
# subject to: r^T * w = target_return
# 1^T * w = 1
# w >= 0

# Here, w is the vector of asset weights, Σ is the covariance matrix, 
# and r is the vector of expected returns.

import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the portfolio optimization problem
expected_returns = np.array([0.1, 0.2])
cov_matrix = np.array([[0.01, 0.0012], [0.0012, 0.04]])
target_return = 0.15

# Objective function
def objective(w):
    return 0.4 * w @ cov_matrix @ w

# Equality constraints
def constraint_returns(w):
    return target_return - np.sum(w * expected_returns)

def constraint_sum(w):
    return 1 - np.sum(w)

# Bounds for weights (0 <= w <= 1)
bounds = [(0, 1), (0, 1)]

# Initial guess for weights
# initial_weights = np.array([0.1, 0.1])

# Set up the constraints
constraints = (
    {"type": "eq", "fun": constraint_returns},
    {"type": "eq", "fun": constraint_sum},
)

# Solve the optimization problem
result = minimize(
    objective,
    initial_weights,
    method="SLSQP",
    bounds=bounds,
    constraints=constraints,
    options={'ftol': 1e-9, 'maxiter': 1000}
)

optimal_weights = result.x

print("Optimal weights:", optimal_weights)



# Example result
# Optimal weights: [[0.55555556] [0.44444444]]

# This solution suggests that we should allocate approximately 55.56%
# of our portfolio to asset A and 44.44% to asset B to minimize risk 
# while achieving a 15% target return.

# Keep in mind that this is a simple example and does not account for 
# many factors that would be considered in a real-world portfolio optimization 
# problem, such as transaction costs, liquidity constraints, etc. 
# However, it demonstrates how to use the cvxopt library to solve a more
# context-specific quadratic optimization problem.
