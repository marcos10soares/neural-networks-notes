Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) are a type of artificial neural network that use radial basis functions (RBFs) as activation functions in the hidden layer. RBFNs consist of an input layer, a single hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer passes the data to the hidden layer, which contains RBF neurons. The output layer computes the weighted sum of the hidden layer activations to produce the final output.

RBFs are localized functions, meaning they have a strong response in the vicinity of their center and decay rapidly as the input moves away from the center. This makes RBFNs particularly suitable for tasks where local patterns in the data are crucial, such as function approximation, regression, and pattern recognition.

There are four major methods for RBF training:

    Fixed centers selected at random: In this approach, the centers of the RBFs in the hidden layer are fixed and chosen randomly from the training data. The training process only adjusts the weights between the hidden layer and the output layer, typically using a least squares method. This method is simple and fast, but the randomly selected centers may not provide the best representation of the data.

    Self-organized selection of centers: This approach uses unsupervised learning methods, such as k-means clustering or competitive learning, to determine the centers of the RBFs. By organizing the centers based on the structure of the data, the network can better represent the underlying patterns. After the centers are determined, the output layer weights are trained using a least squares method or gradient descent.

    Supervised selection of centers and spreads: This method uses supervised learning techniques to determine the centers, spreads (widths), and output layer weights simultaneously. The centers and spreads are adjusted to minimize the error between the network output and the target output. One common approach is to use gradient descent or other optimization techniques to minimize the error.

    Regularization: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in RBFNs by adding a penalty term to the error function. The penalty term is typically based on the norm of the output layer weights, which encourages the network to use fewer hidden neurons and produce smoother approximations. Regularization can be used in combination with any of the previously mentioned training methods to improve generalization performance.
